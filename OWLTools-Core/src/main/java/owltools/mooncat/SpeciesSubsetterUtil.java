/**
 * This implements species subsetting (module generation) using
 * OWL reasoning.
 * 
 * The procedure is 
 * 
 * 1. to assert
 *      Thing SubClassOf in_taxon some My-taxon-of-interest
 * 
 * 2. Remove all unsatisfiable classes.
 * 
 * This is a somewhat brutal way of doing things. A more
 * elegant approach would be to test every class (C in_taxon some T),
 * but this would be a little slower. But it avoids stating falsehoods.
 * 
 * The current approach requires removing all taxon-crossing
 * relationships first to avoid removing too many
 * (e.g. if C is unsatisfiable, then homologous_to some C is
 * also unsatisfiable, we don't want to remove the homologs).
 * 
 * A few of these are hardcoded in the module, but the user
 * should be careful to remove others depending on their ontology.
 * 
 * See: https://github.com/obophenotype/uberon/wiki/Taxon-constraints
 * 
 * Note that for this approach to work properly, the ontology used needs to be merged  
 * with a taxonomy ontology providing relations between taxa, and disjoint classes axioms 
 * between sibling taxa (see 
 * http://douroucouli.wordpress.com/2012/04/24/taxon-constraints-in-owl/).
